# react-select-hook-form
This is a sandbox project where I integrate react-select and react-hook-form. This is created with typescript so the typings should be kept.
The difference between this and the proposed solution is that I simulate a normal uncontrolled input here. This provide all the advantages of the uncontrolled input mode.

# Usage
Run ```npm install``` on the first time.
start with ``` npm start ```
